## ⏳Chapter 3 : Software
Software is a collection of instructions, programs, or data that enables a computer to operate and perform specific tasks. These instructions are originally written by humans in a human-readable programming language to guide the computer in completing various operations. Unlike hardware, software is intangible and determines how the hardware functions.

There are several types of software:

🔏 system Software

🤖 Application Software

👩‍💻 Programming Software

🛑 Malicious Software (Malware)
